# InternetTrollAdoptionCentre_web_app
A Ruby web app built on the Sinatra framework to adopt an internet troll.

The Internet Troll Adoption Centre is a web app built using RESTful API where users can register to adopt one or several Internet Trolls including Katie Hopkins, Milo Yiannopoulos and Donald Trump. The front page details all of the available trolls and users can Edit a troll in order to assign a new owner to it. The CSS design makes use of Flexbox and loosely follows Google's Material Design principles.

This project was undertaken as a week-long solo project in Week 5 of Codeclan's 16-week Software Programming bootcamp.
